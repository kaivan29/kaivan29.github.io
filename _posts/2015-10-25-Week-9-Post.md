Namaste,

Into the ninth week of Object Oriented Programming. Highlights of the week:
1. Vector and Allocator
2. Project #3 due
3. Money2020

This week we learned how vectors work with allocators to make cool stuff happen. Also, vectors are built in such a way that they can be given user-defined allocators. Quite cool. And if somebody does not give their own allocator, the vector takes in the default allocator provided by c++. 

Project #3 was crazy. Though it did not seem like that much work but trying to find time and meeting the partner tested our times. We did not have deallocate implemented until the last day and our allocate was broke until the day before. Everything came together on the last day for us. The project helps me understand the memory allocation in a better way. Interesting project indeed.

I am going to money2020 this weekend. I am excited to attend the event. I can't wait to work on my new idea and with the apis there. I will follow up with how the event was on the next article.

Shukriya.

Tip of the Week: Do not wait till the last moment to finish the project. Today was a lot hectic then I had expected.

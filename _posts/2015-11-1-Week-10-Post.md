Namaste,

Into the tenth week of Object Oriented Programming. Highlights of the week:
1. Darwin

This week in class marked the start of the new project, the Darwin. The assignment needs us to create, implement and simulate Darwin's World. Until now we did not know if we were learning C++ or Object Oriented Programming. This project markts the entry of the OOP since Darwin is our world which has various objects that we need to create and make them interact with each other.

In the beginning the project seems a little complicated to me since there were no directions given in terms of what particular functions we needed to make (like in the previous projects). It took me and my partner some brainstorming to figure what was going in Darwins World. Basically we were given independence to create classes for real-world objects(creatures) that did not have getters and setters. I feel this is a really cool implementation; me and my partner are halfway through it and are exited how it is going to work out in the end. Unitl then I will see you next week.

Shukriya.

Tip of the Week: When a company offers you a offer through UT career services they are obliged to give 3 weeks of time to decide for the offer. (I didn't know that).

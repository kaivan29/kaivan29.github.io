Namaste,

Into the eleventh week of Object Oriented Programming. Highlights of the week:
1. Darwin is due
2. New project - Life

This week in class we learned about T&& var which is called a r-value reference. We had been using constant references to prevent the copying of the objects. We used the the above implementation to keep the data that temporary object holds.

Oh my was Darwin tough! Darwin turned out to be the most difficult project of the class. The deadline for the project was on Thursday but we had all except for Unit tests done until Wednesday. That was a good feeling. Though we added the best creature to Darwin on Thursday once we were done with the project. Trying to make the classes Darwin - Creature - Species communicate with each other without using getters and setters was tricky. Documentation took us quite amount of time. In all the project was really great practice to understand object oriented programming.

Life is the new and last project assigned to us. I am looking for a partner as of now and excited for this last project. I want to do good on this project so that I can enjoy my thanksgiving :D.

Shukriya.

Tip of the Week: Take your core classes at community college. A much better option in terms of fee and maintaining your GPA.

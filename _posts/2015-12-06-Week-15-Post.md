Namaste,

This was the last week OOP. Highlights of this week:
1. Test2

Test2. I was so freaked out for this test. I practiced all the code on his website and the quizzes. My test didnt go as i expected and I feel I could have done better. Overall, I feel I could have learned more from the class if I had put a little more effort into it. This class didn't have that much OOP ironically but alot of finer details about c++.

About downing, I like the way how downing teaches and he definitely makes it more interesting. It has been one of the few CS classes that kept me interested during the lectures. About class, I am sure everyone in the class will end up at a great firm and doing great things in class. P.S at least with the people I have worked with. So talented and I have learned so much from every group project.

Good luck with the finals and Happy holidays.

Shukriya.

Tip: Everybody will tell you this -> Take a downing class if you are at UT. I approve the message.

Namaste,

Into the third week of Object Oriented Programming. Highlights of the week:
1. Project Voting.
2. Jain Festival.

This week we started our second project involving the Australian Voting system. The system is very unique based with voters voting for candidates according to their preference. Since this is our second project, we are going to work in a team of two for the rest of the semester. Though are partners will keep changing for each project.

My partner on this project is Lyee Chong. We met in the lab while working on the first project. We are incorporating the pair programming techniques that weâ€™ve been reading about. In the beginning we decided what objects we will need for the project and what will the attributes of each object will be. We have worked on it twice until now and  we have been able get a basic solution working until now.

I follow Jainism and the past whole week my festival, Samvatsari, was going on. We pray and celebrate the enlightenment of our twenty four thirthankars (God).

Tip of the Week: CNS career fair! I am pumped and hopeful that I can get an internship for this summer. Do not have a resume that is more tahn a page long. Be precise and concies. Also for the interview round be well versed with Data Structures and Algorithms.

Shukriya,
Kaivan

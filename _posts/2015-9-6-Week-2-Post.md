Namaste,

**1. What did you do this past week?**

I started the first project collatz and got the git education account. Cade the private repo: collatz and had a successful build on travis.

**2. What's in your way?**

Not much. I have been preparing for the interviews and career fair that is coming soon.

**3. What will you do next week?**

Work on collatz for this class.
I also have to finish competitve programming and mobile computing assignments.

**4. What's my experience of the class?**

We got our first project assigned to us this week, Collatz. Throughout the week the lectures were focused on the project with him explaining the details what the project asked and needed from us. He is very specific with all the detials of the project and that is because the code is checked using a script. So, basically if we have one of the process going wrong the script will return with an error and zero points. The lectures of prof. Downing are very detailed. I like how he goes into detail of even the basic concepts so that they fit in our head and we never make those silly mistakes. The quiz questions were adopted from the readings and his in-class teachings.

**5. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

Use Piazza! Piazza is a source of information with people collaborating and posting notes and helpful tips. I believe every class should make it mandatory to use Piazza.

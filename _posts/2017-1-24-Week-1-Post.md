Namaste,

I am Kaivan and I will posting about my experience of attending the CS 373 class every week this semester.

**1. What did you do this past week?**

I missed the first two classes because I was in India and I had a wedding to attend. I flew back to Austin late Sunday and so I was hell sleepy in the class on Monday.

**2. What's in your way?**

This is going to be my last semester so I am excited to graduate. I have a long semester with 16 hours worth of credit. But it is the first time in my college career that I have all the classes that I like, lol. 

**3. What will you do next week?**

Try to catch on all the stuff from the classes that I have missed in the first week.

**4. What's my experience of the class?**

Prof. Downing's main topic for the class was Collatz conjecture. Collatz takes a positive int and performs certain opertains based on the int being even or odd. I felt the class was a bit fast according to my pace. But I was still able to understand the material. I am looking forward to post about the class on weekly basis and get better on writing posts.

**5. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

Almost forgot this! (http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). If anybody needs help setting up a blog on github, follow this link. It helped me out :D.

Thank you,
Kaivan

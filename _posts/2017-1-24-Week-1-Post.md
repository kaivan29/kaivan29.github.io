Namaste,

I am Kaivan and I will posting about my experience of attending the CS 373 class every week this semester.

About Prof. Downing:
1. Everybody under CS program takes Prof. Downing once in their 4 years at UT.
2. The class is intense and one will learn alot.
3. One does need to be nervous but excited since there is a lot of valuable stuff to learn in the class.
4. He is an interactive professor! So one will never sleep in his class. :D
5. He has attendance mandotary(via Canvas) with 5 abscences equalling a letter grade drop! So one has to attend almost each and every class.

I missed the first two classes because I was in India and I had a wedding to attend. I flew back to Austin late Sunday and so I was hell sleepy in the class on Monday. Prof. Downing's main topic for the class was Collatz conjecture. Collatz takes a positive int and performs certain opertains based on the int being even or odd. I felt the class was a bit fast according to my pace. But I was still able to understand the material. I am looking forward to post about the class on weekly basis and get better on writing posts. Ciao!

Tip of the week: 
Almost forgot this! (http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). If anybody needs help setting up a blog on github, follow this link. It helped me out :D.

Thank you,
Kaivan

Namaste,

**1. What did you do this past week?**

Finally got done with hw1 and project 1 in Artificial Intelligence, and also finished my competitive programming assignments.
Started doing netflix with my partner. We are almost halfway done.

**2. What's in your way?**

We have a career fair this week, which I'll be attending. Netflix is due. App proposals in Mobile Computing are due.

**3. What will you do next week?**

Finish up Netflix. Give me LEB 320 test and make a poster for mobile computing class.

**4. What's my experience of the class?**

I have been learning a lot about Python. There seem to be a lot of minute wierd details in Python that I would never have known about if we hadnâ€™t covered them in class.
Some of these could definitely lead to a significant amount of time being spent on debugging.

**5. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

CNS career fair! I am pumped and hopeful that I can get an internship/full time offer for this summer.
Do not have a resume that is more than a page long. Be precise and concies.
Also for the interview round be well versed with Data Structures and Algorithms.

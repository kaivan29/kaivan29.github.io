Namaste,

**1. What did you do this past week?**

Worked on my AI and Mobile computing assignments.

**2. What's in your way?**

Not much. I have been preparing for the interviews.

**3. What will you do next week?**

Work on test for this class.
I also have to finish competitve programming and mobile computing assignments.

**4. What's my experience of the class?**

We have a test next week. Throughout the week the lectures were focused on the project with him explaining the details what the project asked and needed from us. He is very specific with all the detials of the project and that is because the code is checked using a script. So, basically if we have one of the process going wrong the script will return with an error and zero points. The lectures of prof. Downing are very detailed. I like how he goes into detail of even the basic concepts so that they fit in our head and we never make those silly mistakes. The quiz questions were adopted from the readings and his in-class teachings.

**5. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

Attend as many Hackathons as you can. You learn so much in 24hrs that you never expected to put your hands on. And try to build something, just do not give up. Give it your all, get out of your comfort zone and try to be creative with whatever you can. I am sure it will be an experience to remember!

Namaste,

**1. What did you do this past week?**



**2. What's in your way?**


**3. What will you do next week?**


**4. What's my experience of the class?**


**5. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

I learned something new this week, about github, that one can delete the subfolder/directory. On your local repo input in the terminal: "git rm -f --cached foldername" and add, commit, push the change made.

Namaste,

**1. What did you do this past week?**

Finished Collatz that was due this week. 

**2. What's in your way?**


**3. What will you do next week?**


**4. What's my experience of the class?**

I implemented the lazy cache and got my code to pass the first 4 tests on hackerrank. Getting it to work more faster was a problem for me. Took me awhile to do it. Finally a day before it was due I figured that I had to implement a meta cache. 

**5. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

I learned something new this week, about github, that one can delete the subfolder/directory. On your local repo input in the terminal: "git rm -f --cached foldername" and add, commit, push the change made.

Namaste,

**1. What did you do this past week?**

Pretty eventful week. I had a superrday with capital one in dallas for which they flew me :D.
It was the shortest flight I have been on (just 40 mins long). To be honest it was more like a hassle but eh.
My stay was in a hotel in downtown, named Zaza. Pretty rad hotel and I enjoyed my stay there.
On friday we went to the plano campus of capital one and visited the offices.
It looks like Capital one really has grown into a tech company rather than a bank. They also gave me free wireless beats hearphone :D
Not only that they took us to a Mavs vs Grizzlies game that night. And it was Yogi all the way. I had a lot of fun throughout the weekend :)

**2. What's in your way?**

I have an interview with Magic Leap! I am so nervous and excited at the same time. Hopefully it goes well.
I also have a Google interview on Tuesday and AI midterm on thursday.

**3. What will you do next week?**

Try to wrap up everything before the spring break.

**4. What's my experience of the class?**

Did pretty bad on the test. Multiple choice took me by surprise and I guess I was not prepared for that. :(
I need to do really well in the class no to get a good grade.

**5. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

Tip of the Week: I feel one should attend as many hackathons as they can. One can learn at an exponential rate in these 24 hours.

Thank you,
Kaivan

Namaste,

**1. What did you do this past week?**
Finally I heard back from Magic Leap and I will be interning there this summer :)

**2. What's in your way?**

IDB3 is due.
AI hw7
Competitve programming week 11 assignment
Android app Beta version

**3. What will you do next week?**

Try to wrap up everything.

**4. What's my experience of the class?**

Class is getting harder now. I need to pick the slack up.

**5. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

Github only provides 5 private repos. Bitbucket is a better option with unlimited private repos. So if you ever run out of private repos on github do not worry, you have bit bucket! :D

Thank you,
Kaivan

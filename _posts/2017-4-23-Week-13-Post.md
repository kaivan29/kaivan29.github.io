Namaste,

**1. What did you do this past week?**

Went to my brothers house as he had a house party! Had a lot of fun, much needed before the finals.

And Barcelona won the EL clasico!!!! And the winner was scored by none other than the best player in the world LIONEL MESSI! It was an icing on the cake and what a way to score 500th goal for your club. Absolutely magical to watch it live :)

Finally I heard back from Capital One and I will be working full time there in september after my internship :)

Worked on Android Weather App for my android class.

**2. What's in your way?**

AI hw8 is due

Competitve programming week 11 assignment

Android app Beta version

IB 327 Write Up due

**3. What will you do next week?**

We are almost done. Work on my AI hw and competitive programming assignment.
Will have to shell out some time for the ANdroid app because the beta deadline is coming closer.
IB 327 write up is huge and will have to allocate time for it.

**4. What's my experience of the class?**

Ran into some problems with Visualization and will have it work it out over the week with my group as we got to know it is due the week we present the project. duh :/
Also, Class is getting harder now. I need to pick the slack up.

**5. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

Do not code on Visual Studio. Visual Studio has a good debugging tool but it can be a pain if you need the code to work on some other compiler.

Thank you,
Kaivan

Namaste,

**1. What did you do this past week?**

I learned how to talk to the API for my android project.

**2. What's in your way?**

Android Reviews is due.
Competitive programming assignment is due on monday.

**3. What will you do next week?**

Try to wrap up everything.

**4. What's my experience of the class?**

Quizzes are getting tougher by the day. I hope he drops a lot of them

**5. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

Take your core classes at community college. A much better option in terms of fee and maintaining your GPA.

Thank you,
Kaivan

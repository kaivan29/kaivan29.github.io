Namaste,

This is going to my last post for SWE and my time at UT. I am going to graduate and cannot wait.

What I learned in the class?
- Learned React, Javascript and HTML by myself for the project.
- Downing teaches python really well. I enjoyed those classes.
- He also touched Databases (SQL), xml and json concepts. 
- Learned about refactoring in java, which is a very good way of improving the program.
I honestly do not know why we learned about Java since it was in no way related with building the website.
Though I can see since it is "software engineering", he had to introduce java in some or the other way.

Tip:
- Be proactive and learn ReactJS/Angular3 (frontend) and flask,python,postgres Sql (backend).
Invest time and you will learn a great deal by the end of the projects.
- Prepare for the quizzes in every class, since they are major part of your grade. They will also help a lot like a lot with the tests.

Thank you,
Kaivan
